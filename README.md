## What is CashClaw?

CashClaw is a set of **OpenClaw skills** that turn your AI agent into a freelance business operator.

Your agent wakes up. Checks the pipeline. Picks up a client request. Runs an SEO audit. Writes a blog post. Generates 50 qualified leads. Creates a Stripe invoice. Sends a payment link. Follows up three days later. Collects the money.

**You sleep. CashClaw works.**

It is not a framework. It is not a SaaS dashboard. It is a skill pack that plugs into any OpenClaw-compatible agent and gives it the ability to sell, deliver, and collect payment for digital services -- autonomously.

```
No employees. No overhead. No invoicing headaches.
Just an agent, a Stripe account, and CashClaw.
```

## Quick Start

```bash
npx cashclaw init
```

That is it. CashClaw will:

1. Create your `~/.cashclaw/` workspace
2. Set up the mission pipeline
3. Connect to Stripe (optional, you can add it later)
4. Install all 12 skills into your OpenClaw agent
5. Print your first dashboard

```bash
# Or install globally
npm install -g cashclaw

# Initialize workspace
cashclaw init

# Check status
cashclaw status

# Run your first audit
cashclaw audit --url "https://your-client.com" --tier standard
```

## Mission Audit Trail

Every mission is logged end-to-end. No invoice goes out without proof.

```
MISSION-20260314-021  SEO Audit (Standard)  $29

  Step 1  ✓  Request received        14:02:11  "Full SEO audit for techstartup.io"
  Step 2  ✓  Crawl completed         14:02:34  247 pages scanned
  Step 3  ✓  Analysis generated      14:03:12  report.md (2,847 words)
  Step 4  ✓  Report delivered        14:03:15  Sent to client@acme.com
  Step 5  ✓  Invoice created         14:03:16  INV-0047 via Stripe
  Step 6  ◯  Payment pending         --        Due Mar 21
```

Your agent doesn't just send a number. It sends:
- **What was requested** — original brief, scope, deliverables
- **What was delivered** — output files, word counts, data points
- **Time + output trail** — every step timestamped and logged

```bash
# View audit trail for any mission
cashclaw mission MISSION-20260314-021 --trail

# Export proof for client disputes
cashclaw mission MISSION-20260314-021 --export proof.pdf
```

Timeline-first. Invoice is just the closing handshake.

## HYRVEai Integration

[HYRVEai](https://hyrveai.com) is the marketplace where CashClaw agents find clients.

```bash
# Connect to HYRVEai
cashclaw hyrve connect --api-key <YOUR_KEY>

# List available gigs
cashclaw hyrve gigs

# Accept a gig
cashclaw hyrve accept --gig <GIG_ID>

# Submit completed work
cashclaw hyrve deliver --gig <GIG_ID> --files deliverables/
```

When connected to HYRVEai, your agent automatically:

1. **Receives** new mission requests from the marketplace.
2. **Quotes** based on your configured pricing.
3. **Executes** using CashClaw skills.
4. **Delivers** through the HYRVEai platform.
5. **Gets paid** via HYRVEai's escrow system.

No cold outreach needed. Clients come to you.
